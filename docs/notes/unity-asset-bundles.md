# Unity: Asset Bundles


## Creating/Assigning files/folders to an asset bundle

1. Select the file/folder you want to assign to an asset bundle
2. On the Inspect window, at the very bottom, click on the first dropdown of `Asset Bundle`
3. Click on `new`
4. Give it a name
5. You now have an Asset Bundle that can be added to other places by simply clicking the dropdown and selecting it.

If you assign a folder to an Asset Bundle, everything inside it (every file and subfolder) will be assigned to the same Asset Bundle.


## Building the asset bundle

1. Right click the folder and select `Build AssetBundles`

The asset bundle will be built in the `Assets/AssetBundles` folder.
