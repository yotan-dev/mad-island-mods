2. HFramework must be installed.


## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/yotan-dev/mad-island-mods/releases)
2. Move the ZIP file to your BepInEx plugins folder (`right click the game on Steam > Manage > Browser local files`, then go to `BepInEx/plugins`)
3. Extract the ZIP file there (use "Extract here" option)
4. Start the game once so config files are generated by it.
5. Close the game

## Features

### Require Foreplay

For H-Scenes with players, NPCs will refuse to continue if the player tries to "insert" before they are ready.

To enable it, go to `BepInEx/config/HFramework.json` and set `RequireForeplay` to `true`.

In the same file you can customize the required bar level and whether you want age and some random factors to apply over it.
