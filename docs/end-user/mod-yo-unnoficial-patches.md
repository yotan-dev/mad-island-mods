# Mod: YoUnnoficialPatches

Bug fixes implemented via modding. Let me know if there are other bugs that could be looked into.

Included:

- Translation (always on)
	- Translation of some boss names from Japanese to English
	- Translation of Quest UI titles to english
	- Translation of Surgery table / Cute Mirror to english
	- Translation of Craft "Ingredients", Shop "Buy", and "Paused" texts
	- Translation of Dye table UI from Japanese to English
- Prevent NPCs from starting H-Scenes if they don't have one
	- Enabled by default, can be disabled by changing `DontStartInvalidSex` in the config
- Fix some mosaics that are not being cleaned up
	- Enabled by default, can be disabled by changing `FixMosaic` in the config

I won't fix:

- Friend NPCs attacking new childs (without being able to hit) -- too hard to change with mods
- Automatically moving to the right -- I could not find the cause, looks like out of the game

## Requirements

1. Yotan Mod Core must be installed.


## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/yotan-dev/mad-island-mods/releases)
2. Move the ZIP file to your BepInEx plugins folder (`right click the game on Steam > Manage > Browser local files`, then go to `BepInEx/plugins`)
3. Extract the ZIP file there (use "Extract here" option)
4. Start the game once so config files are generated by it.
5. Close the game
