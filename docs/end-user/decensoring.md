# Decensoring

If you are looking for decensoring, DON'T install generic decensoring mods (e.g. combinedmeshdemosaic or similar), those might break the game.

Instead, do the following:

1. Go to your game folder (right click the game on Steam > Manage > Browser local files)
2. Go to the `Mad Island_Data/StreamingAssets/XML/` folder
3. Create a BAT file named `none.bat`

> [!WARNING]
> It is VERY important that this is considered a BAT/Windows Batch File. It MUST NOT be a text file.
>
> If in doubt, tell your windows to show file extensions and make sure it is ending in `.bat`.
>
> You can enable extension display by clicking on the "View" tab in file explorer and checking "File name extensions". (Windows 10)
>

Creating this file will enable the game's official decensoring, which works for most of the cases, except a very few.

Next, you should install Yotan Mod Core and Yo Unnoficial Patches mods, which will fix some of the remaining cases, in a game specific way.
A few, rare cases, are still broken and will eventually be fixed in newer versions of Yo Unnoficial Patches.
