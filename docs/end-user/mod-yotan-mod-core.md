# Mod: Yotan Mod Core

Yotan Mod Core is a base library/framework to simplify mod creation.

As an end user, it does little to your game directly, BUT many mods require it to be installed.


## What it does (for end users)

- Enables many other mods to work
- Adds some new "debug"/console commands (Press ENTER to type) -- See [Console commands](#console-commands)


## Installation

1. Make sure you have [BepInEx installed](./install-bepinex.md)
2. Download the latest version of Yotan Mod Core from [Releases](https://github.com/yotan-dev/mad-island-mods/releases)
3. Move the ZIP file to your Mad Island folder (`right click the game on Steam > Manage > Browser local files` to get to the folder)
4. Extract the ZIP file there (use "Extract here" option)
5. Allow it to "replace" files (it will merge its content within the BepInEx folder)
6. Start the game once so additional files are generated by it.
7. Close the game

You should now be ready to install mods. You probably want to go to [Enhanced Island](/enhanced-island/introduction.html) next.


## Console commands

**Note:** whenever `[friendId]` is mentioned, it is optional and when not informed it will follow this order:

1. Try to get selected NPC
2. If no NPC is selected, selects active player

- `/faint [friendId]`
	- faints a character (Stun)
	- `[friendId]` is the target NPC friend ID
- `/heal`, `/healhp`, `/healst`, `/healfood`, `/healwater`
	- heals player HP/Stamina/Food/Water (`/heal` heals everything)
- `/makevirgin [friendId]`
	- resets basic sex info so character is considered virgin again
	- `[friendId]` is the target NPC friend ID
- `/moral [value] [friendId]`
	- changes character moral to `value`
	- `[friendId]` is the target NPC friend ID
- `/stun [value]`
	- overrides player stun damage to `value`
	- 0 disables it
