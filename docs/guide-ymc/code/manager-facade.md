# Manager Facade

Manager Facade simplify accessing game's "God" classes, having everything available in a single static class.

Just call `Managers.` and you will have access to the current manager instance you need.

If you need a manager that is not available yet, let me know and I can add it.

See [API: Managers](/api/YotanModCore.Managers.html) for a list of available managers.
