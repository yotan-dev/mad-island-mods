# Constants

The game has a lot of content that comes in certain numeric or string form, where the values are important,
for example, NPC IDs (which identify which kind of NPC it is), Unity Tags, Layers, etc.

Yotan Mod Core provides a set of constants for you, with values already mapped in a nice to read way.

You can find all the available constants on `YotanModCore.Consts` namespace, and I try to keep them up to date
whenever a new version of the game is available.

See [API: Consts](/api/YotanModCore.Consts.html) for a list of available constants.
