# YoCustomItems

Custom items for Mad Island by Yotan.

This adds a few custom items to the game as listed below.

Note that this mod is more like a showcase of examples using YotanModCore/HFramework for new items, rather than
some serious new item pack. Still, all items here should be completely functional and safe to use in your game.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have YotanModCore installed
2. Download the latest release of YoCustomItems from [Releases](https://github.com/yotan-dev/mad-island-mods/releases)
3. Extract the downloaded zip into `Mad Island Folder/BepInEx/CustomBundles/` (replace previous versions if any)

After that, you can start the game and the items should be available.


## Items

- Scifi Bench (`scifi_bench`)
	- A work bench to create the new items
	- Can be crafted in the wood workbench

- Future Barrel (`future_barrel`)
	- A barrel that can be placed -- does nothing
	- Can be crafted in the scifi bench

- Land Mine (`land_mine`)
	- A placeable mine item that explodes on contact, causing damage to the area around it.
