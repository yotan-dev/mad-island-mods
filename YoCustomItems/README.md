# YoCustomItems

Custom items for Mad Island by Yotan.

This adds a few custom items to the game as listed below.

Note that this mod is more like a showcase of examples using YotanModCore/HFramework for new items, rather than
some serious new item pack. Still, all items here should be completely functional and safe to use in your game.

## Items

- Land Mine (`land_mine`)
	A placeable mine item that explodes on contact, causing damage to the area around it.
